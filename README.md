# Roadside Assist

Roadside Assist is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a roadside assistance web app.

If say, a vehicle breaks down or requires assistance, Roadside Assist provides an easy to use web interface that can help our customers -

1. Provide details about the incident, including where they are.
2. Have a service provider assigned to them, whom they can track on screen (built using Google Maps API).
3. Chat with the service provicer while they are enroute (in development).
